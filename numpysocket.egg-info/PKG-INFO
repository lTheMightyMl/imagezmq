Description: # NumpySocket
        ## About
        This python module is designed to send/receive Numpy arrays (compressed) over a TCP/IP socket. It was originally written to stream video frames from OpenCV however any Numpy array should work.
        
        The original purpose of this module is to send video frames (captured with OpenCV) from a headless Raspberry PI to another computer.
        
        ## Terminology
        ### Server
        The machine sending the Numpy array
        
        ### Client
        The machine receiving the Numpy array
        
        ## Status
        Early Development
        
        ## My Changes
        Added multithreaded data transimission, increasing throughput.
