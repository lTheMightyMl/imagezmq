# NumpySocket
## About
This python module is designed to send/receive Numpy arrays (compressed) over a TCP/IP socket. It was originally written to stream video frames from OpenCV however any Numpy array should work.

The original purpose of this module is to send video frames (captured with OpenCV) from a headless Raspberry PI to another computer.
